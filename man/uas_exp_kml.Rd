\description{
Export geometry(s) from a flight to KML and Shapefile
}
\details{
\code{flt_idx} allows you to specify a subset of image folders in \code{x} to process (use names(x) to see what those are).

\code{ctr}, \code{fp}, and \code{mcp} (all TRUE/FALSE) specify which geometry(s) to export.
Output file names will be generated from the flight metadata saved in the uas_info object. Alternately,
you can pass the base of a file name using \code{out_fnbase}. You can specify the output directory
with \code{output_dir}. The default is to save them in a sub-directory of the images directory
called 'map', which will be created if needed.

If \code{combine_feats = TRUE}, the geometries from the folders in x will be combined into a single KML or Shapefile.
For this to happen, you must also pass a value for \code{combine_fn} (a base for the file name of the combined features).
